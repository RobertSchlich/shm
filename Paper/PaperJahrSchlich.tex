The dependability and the accuracy of structural health monitoring systems are significantly affected by sensor faults. 
In this paper, the design and implementation of a wireless structural health monitoring system, capable of decentralized autonomous fault detection, are presented. 
For self-detecting sensor faults, each sensor node predicts its expected sensor data and compares it to the measured sensor data. 
The predictions are computed using neural networks \textbf{with measured sensor data} of adjacent sensor nodes.
In laboratory experiments, devised to validate the proposed approach, several simulated sensor faults are detected.
These results indicate that the use of neural networks increases the dependability and the accuracy of structural health monitoring systems.

%Civil engineering structures are designed to resist extensive external impact over several decades. 
%Over time, the structural stability can decrease to an hazardous level. 
%To prevent structural failure, demolition and replacement of the building or rehabilitation and repair works have to be considered.
%From the outside, it is hard to determine whether building structures are damaged.
%To decide whether cost- and scheduling-intensive strengthening actions are required and to predict failure in advance, structural health monitoring (SHM) is used.
%
%\cite[4]{BisbySHM} defines SHM as "a non-destructive \textit{in-situ} structural evaluation method that uses any of several sensors which are attached to, or embedded in, a structure". 
%The obtained sensor data is "collected, analyzed and stored".
%The structure is observed over long periods of time - up to several years - using data obtained by sensor nodes attached to the \textbf{construction}.
%Via analyzing the measured data, such as acceleration or strain, changes in material and geometric behaviour can be recognized early on.
%
%
%((((
%
%Traditionally, the used sensor nodes are wired with optical fiber cables. 
%However, using wired SHM systems has several disadvantages: 
%For monitoring large constructions like bridges or high-rise buildings, many sensor nodes and therefore a big amount of wire is needed, raising material and personnel expenses.
%Optimal positions for sensor nodes can be impossible to wire and clamps can damage the facade. 
%Visible wires compromise the aesthetic view of a construction and draw interest to vandalism.

%
%Wireless SHM systems are composed of a several sensor nodes, a base station and a personal computer, that communicate by radio. 
%Therefore, the named disadvantages of cables do not apply.
%Wireless SHM, however, bear some challenges that have to be considered. 
%Electricity supply is constrained to battery life or expensive alternative power suppliers.
%The transmitter signal strength has to be optimized to span long distances without disturbing nearby electronic devices or humans.
%Data security may have to be ensured by encrypting the transmitted data and eliminating the possibility of data manipulation.In this case
%When using several different sensor nodes, the timestamps of single measurement values can differ. 
%To assure the relatability of the sensor data, it is therefore necessary to synchronize all sensor timers. 
%
%Over time, sensors can break and become faulty. Faults can be due to either sudden failure or gradually loss of accuracy.
%To ensure the dependability and the accuracy of the structural health monitoring system, these sensor faults must be detected and eliminated in real time.

%To autonomously detect sensor faults, several different approaches have been tested.

%This paper shows a wireless structural health monitoring system with autonomous fault detection. 
%At first, the SHM system is designed and implemented.

Civil engineering structures are exposed to external impacts over several decades. 
To ensure the structural stability and evaluate the conditions of civil engineering structures, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems can be installed.
\cite[4]{BisbySHM} defines SHM as "a non-destructive \textit{in-situ} structural evaluation method that uses any of several sensors which are attached to, or embedded in, a structure". 
The obtained sensor data is "collected, analyzed and stored" over long periods of time.
Analysis of the sensor data can reveal abnormal changes in material and geometric behaviour early on.

Traditionally, the sensor nodes are wired with cables and connected to computer systems.
However, using wired SHM systems has several disadvantages, including expensive wiring, high personnal costs and inaccessibility of optimal positions with wiresIn this case.
In wireless SHM systems, the sensor nodes communicate with a base station via radio, ruling out wiring-specific problems.
When using wireless SHM systems, one has to consider battery life and sensor node \textit{sychronization}.

Over time, sensors can break and become faulty. Failures can either occur suddenly, or be due to gradual loss of accuracy.
To ensure the dependability and the accuracy of the SHM system, these sensor faults must be detected and isolated in real time. 
A simple approach to fault detection is the installation of physically redundant sensors.
Faulty sensors can easily be identified through the deviation of their measurements from the measurements of other sensors.
Physical redundancy, although efficient at sensor fault detection, has the disadvantage of increased installation and maintenance costs. \cite{SmarslyDA}
A technologically more advanced approach, called analytical redundancy, applies knowledge of the structure and the SHM system itself to compute virtual sensor measurements for each sensor. 
For example, a FEM model could be used in combination with data from adjacent sensor nodes to calculate a virtual measurement of one sensor.
If analytical redundancy is implemented correctly, virtual measurements always simulate a correct working sensor; therefore actual measurements deviating from their virtual counterparts indicate faulty sensors.\cite{SmarslyDA} \todo{andere Quelle}

In this study, analytical redundancy is realized by artificial neural networks.
Artificial neural networks consist of interconnected data processing elements called neurons. 
Neurons are grouped in different layers; they consist of one input layer, a number of hidden layers and one output layer.
Artificial neural networks have the distinct ability of learning by adjusting the weights of the inter-neuron connections, until a set of given input variables results in the desired output variables.
If implemented correctly, a neural network can be trained to approximate any mathematical functions with arbitrary accuracy. \todo{Zitat Li}

This paper is organized as follows:
First, a wireless structural health monitoring system is designed and implemented. 
Next, a neural network is implemented in each sensor node and trained to predict the measurements of said node in order to detect faults. 
The system is then tested in laboratory experiments. 
Finally, the experimental results are analyzed and future research directions proposed.

\section*{Design and implementation of the wireless structural health monitoring system}

\textbf{1. paragraph: SHM general}

\begin{itemize}
\item wireless SHM system consits of nodes and base station
\item nodes collect data, and process data
\item processed data is sent to base station and personal computer
\item data is stored in database
\end{itemize}


According to \cite[5]{BisbySHM}, a structural health monitoring system commonly consists of the following components:
1. data acquisition,
2. data transmission, 
3. data processing,
4. data storage,
5. diagnostics and 
6. information retrieval.

Task 1. to 3. are implemented on the building site, tasks 4. to 6. at a workstation. 
A wireless SHM system installed on the building site consists of sensor nodes attached to the construction, a base station and a local computer. 
The base station, which can be an external device or a computer program, links the individual sensor nodes with each other and the local computer.
To each sensor node, several sensors measuring different physical quantities may be connected. 
During a measurement, the sensor nodes acquire sensor data and may perform initial processing.
The processed data is then transmitted via radio to the base station and, from there, to the local computer. 
At the computer, the data gets stored accessible and save, e. g. in a database for analysis and diagnosis.

\textbf{3. paragraph: UML / Java implementaion}

%According to [3], a structural health monitoring system basically consists of the following components:
%1. data acquisition, 2. data communication, 3. data processing, 4. data storage, 5. diagnostics and 6. data retrieval.
%
%
%
%For autonomous fault detection in wireless SHM systems, an integrated fault detection and synchronization strategy is implemented into a wireless SHM system. The SHM system consists of wireless sensor nodes and a base station. The sensor nodes are installed on the monitored structure and the base station links the wireless SHM system and a local computer.
%
%
%In the present study, wireless sensor nodes of the type “Oracle Sun SPOTs” are used. The sensor nodes are Java-programmable enabling embedded analyses and the sensor nodes include a 3-dimensional accelerometer, temperature and other sensors (Oracle Lab, 2014). In this study, acceleration measurements taken from the structure are used for analyzing the structural condition. Furthermore, the radios of the sensor nodes ensure wireless communications between the sensor nodes as well as between the sensor nodes and the base station in order to transmit monitoring data or control commands. The base station is able to receive monitoring data measured by the sensor nodes, and the base station can store the data in a database installed on the local computer. The main Java classes are shown in an Unified Modelling Language diagram (UML diagram), which is a standard way to visualize the implementation of a application. The following UML diagrams (cp. Figure 1 and Figure 2) show just the main classes embedded into the base station and the sensor nodes. In the following subsection, the implementation of the main components of the fault detection strategy, including synchronization and fault detection, are shown.

\section*{Implementation and training of neural networks}

\textbf{1. paragraph: neural networks general}

\todo[inline]{Die Vorteile von neuronalen Netzwerken müssen m.E. noch in der Einleitung heruasgearbeitet werden}

Artificial neural networks were developed, driven by the desire to enable computer systems to learn autonomously.
This development is based on the attempt to emulate the data processing mechanics of the human brain. %(and is therefore inherently interwoven with advances in neuroscience)
In an artificial neural network \emph{neurons} are grouped in different \emph{layers}, as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:neuralnetwork}. 
Each neuron sends data exclusively to neurons from neighbouring layers through weighted \emph{connections}.
For each neuron a \emph{propagation function} processes incoming data, in consideration of the connection weights, to the net input.
An \emph{activation function} then processes the net input to calculate the activation of the neuron, which subsequently determines its output. \cite{KrieselNN}

A neural network learns, most commonly, by adjusting its connection weights until it recreates the results of a desired transfer function with sufficient accuracy.
In our case...
